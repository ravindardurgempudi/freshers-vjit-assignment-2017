<p>Food First envisions a world in which all people have access to healthy,
 ecologically produced, and culturally appropriate food. After 40 years of analysis of
  the global food system, we know that making this vision a reality involves more than technical
   solutions—it requires political transformation. That’s why Food First supports activists,
    social movements, alliances, and coalitions working for systemic change. 
    Our work—including action-oriented research, publications, 
    projects and Food Sovereignty Tours—gives you the tools to understand the global challenges, 
    build your local movement, and engage with the global movement for food sovereignty.</p>
